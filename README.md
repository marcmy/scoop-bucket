Just a little scoop (https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Scoop) bucket I made to keep up with some projects as conveniently as possible.

## How to install these apps

```pwsh
scoop bucket add marcmy https://github.com/marcmy/scoop-bucket
scoop install marcmy/<appname>

e.g.
scoop install marcmy/quake3e
```
